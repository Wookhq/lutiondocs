## What is Lution? üêß

Lution is a **bootstrapper** designed specifically for the **Sober runtime**, which allows you to run Roblox on Linux. While Sober handles the low-level compatibility, Lution provides the high-level tools you need to manage your gaming experience. Just like bootstrappers for Windows (Bloxstrap, Fishstrap... etc), Lution gives you more control, all built with Python for a native Linux feel.

## Key Features ‚öôÔ∏è

As a bootstrapper for Sober, Lution provides a suite of features that give you more control over your gameplay:

* **Player Logging**: Keep a detailed log of your gaming sessions.
* **Fast Flag Editor**: Easily edit Fast Flags to customize your client settings.
* **Mod Support**: Use popular Roblox mods to enhance your game.
