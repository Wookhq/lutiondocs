## What is Lution? üêß

Lution is a **bootstrapper** designed specifically for the **Sober runtime**, which allows you to run Roblox on Linux. While Sober handles the low-level compatibility, Lution provides the high-level tools you need to manage your gaming experience. Just like bootstrappers for Windows, Lution gives you more control, all built with Python for a native Linux feel.
