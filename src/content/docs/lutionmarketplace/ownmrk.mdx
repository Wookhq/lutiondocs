A **personal marketplace provider** enables you to host your own collection of mods and themes. It’s ideal for testing creations, sharing with a small group, or curating a custom collection for your community.

---

### Setup Guide

<Steps>

1. **Fork the Marketplace Repository**
   Create your own copy of the marketplace structure by forking the **Lution-Marketplace** repository on GitHub.

2. **Add Your Content Files**
   In your forked repository, upload your `.zip` files and thumbnails to the appropriate folders:

   * **Mod** `.zip` files → `Assets/Mods/Content/`
   * **Theme** `.zip` files → `Assets/Themes/Content/`
   * **Thumbnail images** → `Assets/thumbnails/`

3. **Configure the Metadata JSON**

   * **`content.json`**: Defines how items are shown in the UI (in `Assets/Mods/content.json` and `Assets/Themes/content.json`).
   * **`info.json`**: Maps display names to `.zip` file paths (in `Assets/Mods/info.json` and `Assets/Themes/info.json`).

4. **Activate Your Marketplace in Lution**
   After pushing your changes to GitHub, configure Lution to use your personal repository via the **Marketplace Settings**. Enter your repo in the format `YourUsername/YourRepoName`.

</Steps>

### 1. Fork the Marketplace Repository

Start by forking the `Lution-Marketplace` repo. This will give you your own working copy to modify, without impacting the original.

---

### 2. Add Your Content Files

Organize and upload your content:

* **Mods**: Place `.zip` files in `Assets/Mods/Content/`
* **Themes**: Place `.zip` files in `Assets/Themes/Content/`
* **Thumbnails**: Add image files to `Assets/thumbnails/`

---

### 3. Configure the Metadata

#### A. `content.json`

This file controls how items are displayed in the marketplace.

Example entry:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "My Mod",
    "body": "My first mod",
    "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourUser/Lution-Marketplace/main/Assets/thumbnails/my-mod.png",
    "button": "Download",
    "creator": "YourName",
    "version": "version-a1b2c3d4",
    "sb": "stable"
  }
]
```

* **`title`**: Item name
* **`body`**: Short description
* **`image`**: Raw GitHub URL to the thumbnail image
* **`button`**: Button label (e.g., "Download")
* **`creator`**: Author’s name
* **`version`**: Compatible game version
* **`sb`**: Stability status (`stable`, `unstable`, `unknown`)

#### B. `info.json`

This file links the displayed name to the actual `.zip` file.

Example entry:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "My Mod",
    "path": "Assets/Mods/Content/mymod.zip"
  }
]
```

> Note: `"name"` **must exactly match** the `"title"` in `content.json`. The `"path"` is a relative path to your `.zip` file.

---

### 4. Use Your Marketplace in Lution

Once your changes are committed:

1. In Lution, navigate to **Marketplace Settings**.
2. Enter your GitHub repository in the format: `YourUsername/YourRepoName`
   *(e.g., `Chip/Lution-Marketplace`)*
3. Lution will now load your mods and themes directly from your customized marketplace.
