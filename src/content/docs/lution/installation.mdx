# How to Install Lution

There are two ways to install Lution. The **Easy Install** is recommended for most users. If that doesn't work, or if you're built diff and prefer to do it manually, follow the manual install steps below.

## Easy Install (Recommended)

This method uses a script to automate setup.
<Steps>

1.  **Prerequisites**
    Make sure `git` is installed. Check with:
    ```
    git --version
    ```
    If not installed, search up how to install git in your distro.

2.  **Clone and Run**
    In terminal, run:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Wookhq/Lution.git
    cd Lution/src
    ./run.sh
    ```
    The script sets up everything and launches Lution. If Streamlit asks for email, just press Enter.

## Manual Installation

<Steps>
1.  **Prerequisites**
    Install `git`, `python3`, and `python3-venv`. For example, I'll use Debian/Ubuntu:
    ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install git python3-venv
    ```
2.  **Clone the Repo**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Lutionhq/Lution.git
    cd Lution
    ```
3.  **Create & Activate Virtual Environment**
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Your prompt should now show `(venv)`.
4.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```
    cd src/Lution
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run Lution**
    ```
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
    Again, skip the email prompt by pressing Enter.

    To run Lution later:
    ```
    cd Lution/src/Lution
    source ../../venv/bin/activate
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
</Steps>
