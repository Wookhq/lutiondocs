**Lution** is a Python-powered bootstrapper for [Sober](https://github.com/SoberX/Sober), the Roblox client for Linux. It’s kind of like **Bloxstrap**, but built for Linux users who want a smoother experience — and yep, it works with your Bloxstrap mods too.

###  Why Use Lution?

* ⚡ **Simple & Lightweight** – Written in Python, no bulky stuff.
* 🛠️ **Mod Support** – Works out of the box with Bloxstrap mods.
* 🧩 **Extra Features** – Adds some nice quality-of-life tweaks to make using Sober just a bit nicer.
